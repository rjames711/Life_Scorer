      Scratch pad to work out how to store task attributes (units etc) in json
      There would be two places where json would be stored; In the task definition
      which would describe the attribute and units, and in log where the value would be recorded
      <br>
      For instance a bench press might have attributes: 
      [ reps , lbs ]
      And the log record might have 
      [reps: 10, lbs: 135]
      Other issue to work is how to score the type of compound units. I think the simplest way 
      would be mulplicative relationship with an additional muliplicative modifier. So for instance 
      the user would what the think a typical log would be:
      <br>
      10 reps at 135 lbs is 20 points
      modifier would be 20/10*135 = .015 
      <br>
      so the attributes def would become:
      <br>
      { 'attr':['reps','lbs'], 'mod': .015   }
  </p>
  <p>
    Also for user epxeriance, would like to store the min, max and default expected value for each value.
    This would set the default, min, max values on an input slider to make loggin easier and quicker.
    So for benchpress the def might become: 
    { 'attr':['reps','lbs'], 'mod': .015, 'val_defaults': {'min': 45 , 'max':200, 'default':135}  }
  </p>
  <script>
    var attr ={ "attr":["reps","lbs"], "mod":0.015, "val_defaults": {"min": 45 , "max":200, "default":135}  }
    
    var attr2 = {"attr":{"reps":{"min": 0 , "max":30, "default":10, "mod":1}, 
    "lbs":{"min": 45 , "max":200, "default":135, "mod":1}}, "default_score":20};
    var log = {"reps":10, "lbs":135,};
    function score(attr, log){
      score  = 1;
       for ( var key in log){
          score *= log[key]
       }
       return score*attr.mod
    }
  </script>
