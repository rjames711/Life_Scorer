Since scoring functionality is finally working getting it to make sense
would probably be top priority now.
-Set point values by compound units
--Ex: 10 benchpress @ 150 lbs =20 points or something 
        and divide to get single point value

-Implement some way of handling units and attirbutes
--Set additional units and attribute in create and edit task
--Default range and type for each attribute
--Maybe set attributes by having a attribute column containing json

-Should be able to click on each dayscore and see further details

-Make decent index page which gives the top level options with big buttons

-In tasks add a column for parent tasks to allow for nested sub tasks
--Potentially implement categories in this way as special task with no parent

-Color coding of buttons by category and type (recurring nonrecurring)

-Add ability to toggle or change display state of tasks in edit tasks

-Look into making db connection a singleton or some other pattern

-filter as you type for tasks

-get https working

-Double check and possible fix the select category part of create task since this was done 
quickly on the fly
