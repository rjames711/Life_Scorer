Since scoring functionality is finally working getting it to make sense
would probably be top priority now.
-Set point values by compound units
--Ex: 10 benchpress @ 150 lbs =20 points or something 
        and divide to get single point value

-Implement some way of handling units and attirbutes
--Set additional units and attribute in create and edit task
--Default range and type for each attribute
--Maybe set attributes by having a attribute column containing json

-(Easy!) add toggle to edit task page so display can be set manually

-Maybe a sort of modifed subtask which won't actually be saved in the task table.
--Could be called 'steps'
--So for instance things like grocery shopping items could be put under a task 
without cluttering the database


-Should be able to click on each dayscore and see further details

-Ability to edit log items

-Make decent index page which gives the top level options with big buttons


-For time being need to just group by category in log screen. Should be 
relatively easy to do. In future do more complex recursive implementation as below.
For now just need something to deal with the large volume of tasks on the screen (59! as of now)
^-In tasks add a column for parent tasks to allow for nested sub tasks
^--Potentially implement categories in this way as special task with no parent

-Color coding of buttons by category and type (recurring nonrecurring)

-Add ability to toggle or change display state of tasks in edit tasks

-Look into making db connection a singleton or some other pattern

-filter as you type for tasks

-get https working

-Double check and possible fix the select category part of create task since this was done 
quickly on the fly 

-Make sure decimal entries (floats) dont cause issues any where
--I check on input for log qty and that seems to work.
--Checked on making point value for tasks a float and it rejects it in client

Enhanced features for journal style entries.
--Larger text fields
--Some sort of concatenations for display based on certain query parameters
