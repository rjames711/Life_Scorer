--data base file per user ex: username.db
--Get registration page working

-Create pages for creating new tasks and categories

-Make decent index page which gives the top level options with big buttons

-In tasks add a column for parent tasks to allow for nested sub tasks
--Potentially implement categories in this way as special task with no parent

-Change how time is handled
--Remove timestamp column from log 
--add month day year time columns to make for easier queries
--Get time date from client (browser or whatever) and do any necessary conversion or formatting in python.
--Or just a date and time column but formatted so its simple to query using python datetime
--Ex:       In [3]: print (datetime.date.today()+datetime.timedelta(2))
